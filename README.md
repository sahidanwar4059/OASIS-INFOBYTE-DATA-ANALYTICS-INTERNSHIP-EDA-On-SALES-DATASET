This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of retail
sales data. The aim is to identify sales patterns, customer behaviors,
and product trends that can help retail businesses make informed
decisions. The analysis involves **data cleaning, descriptive
statistics, time series analysis, customer & product insights, and
visualizations**.
